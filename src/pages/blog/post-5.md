We had 55 registrations, and approximately 30 people turned up, probably a reasonable ratio for a free event.

We ran 4 short community presentations:

*   Grant Boxer: Changing the GIS Paradigm for WA Geologists
*   Esther Harris: QGIS Training from Geos to NGOs
*   Piers Higgs: Around the world with QGIS in 10 minutes
*   Stafford Smith: When you can't buy the tool, make it yourself - Basic plugin development with QGIS

We had pizza & refreshments and a bit of socialising after the presentations, which had a really nice casual community vibe.

After the presentations, several people said they'd be interested in giving a presentation at another similar event, and a couple of people said they'd like to help organise, which makes it a big success in my mind.
